I've spent the last hour or so of the afternoon testing out using a second
screen with my laptop.  And here's the email I've just sent round the office
list as a subtle request for a second monitor of my own:

Ooh, yeah, it's shiny.  It is how I work at home, really, though in that
instance its with two computers.  In some ways this is even better: with two
computers, you have to switch keyboard/mouse and you don't have a shared
pasteboard.  (Well, actually, I suppose you do, you just have to do
<code>pbpaste | ssh otherhost pbcopy</code> in between the copy and paste. :-)
)  I think I might have to try and convince Annabel that we really need a new
flat panel monitor at home too...

I had wondered if my PowerBook would actually do the second monitor thing.  I
know some do, and some only do mirroring.  But yes, for the record, the 17"
PowerBook G4 does support a second monitor that shows independent stuff.  It's
a [Dell E173FP](http://accessories.euro.dell.com/sna/ProductDetail.aspx?sku=35552&s=dhs&cat=snp&c=uk&l=en&cs=ukdhs1&category_id=2999) I've got it connected to just now, which Pete ordered for his PC a
week or so ago.
