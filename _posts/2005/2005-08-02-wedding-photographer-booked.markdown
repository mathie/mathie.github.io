<a href="http://www.jackphoto.co.uk/" title="Jack Photography"><img src="http://www.jackphoto.co.uk/buttons/weddings.jpg" alt="Jack Photography - weddings" class="alignright" /></a>Well, that's the wedding photographer officially booked.  Well, if one of us remembered to post the letter with the cheque for the &pound;200 deposit!  We're using [Jack Photography](http://www.jackphoto.co.uk/).  Gordon, the main photographer, has worked for newspapers like the [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk) and [Daily Record](http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/), by the sounds of it as a paparazzi photographer!  His wedding photographs are, in my humble opinion, absolutely stunning, but the main feature is that he is <em>really</em> quick at taking pictures (all that paparazzi experience, I guess).  Some of the weddings we've been to, the pictures seem to drag on for hours.  He claims never to have taken longer than 20 minutes for the 'standard' group shots.

In addition, we have only agreed in principle, but for an extra charge we will be able to retain the full copyright of the photographs to do with as we like.  In other words, these stunning shots will all make their way up on to the Interweb, reprints will be easily available and we'll know that the original shots are archived forever.
