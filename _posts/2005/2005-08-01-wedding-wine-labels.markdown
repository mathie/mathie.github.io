<a href="http://woss.name/g/v/random/designed/WeddingWineLabel.jpg.html"><img src="http://woss.name/g/d/33-2/WeddingWineLabel.jpg" class="alignright" alt="Wedding wine label" /></a> Annabel has designed a label for the bottles of wine which will be available at our wedding.  All the work was done in Quark XPress 6.0.  The coat of arms at the top is apparently the Matheson Coat of Arms, and the faint image behind is of Edinburgh Castle.  All the details which are required for wine sold in France is printed on the label (there were a few proofs sent back and forth to verify this).  We've printed them out onto appropriate-sized address labels and posted them off to Annabel's Dad, who's in France just now, so they can be attached to the bottles of wine before being brought back into the UK.

And I can tell you that the oak aged red from Allegrets is to die for.  I think a bottle or two may have to be 'tested' before December 19th. :-)  Just to make sure they have travelled and stored OK, you understand.
