<ul>
  <li>[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099450259/mathieoftheen-21) by Mark Haddon (26mm)</li>
  <li>[All Fun And Games Until Somebody Loses An Eye](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316725234/mathieoftheen-21) by Christopher Brookmyre (37mm)</li>
  <li>[Let It Bleed](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0752877194/mathieoftheen-21) by Ian Rankin (27mm)</li>
  <li>[Die Trying](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553505416/mathieoftheen-21) by Lee Childs (37mm)</li>
  <li>[Be My Enemy](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0349116814/mathieoftheen-21) by Christopher Brookmyre (28mm)</li>
  <li>[Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0749922648/mathieoftheen-21) by David Allen (24mm)</li>
  <li>[Stories We Could Tell](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/000715125X/mathieoftheen-21) by Tony Parsons (25mm)</li>
</ul>

That's a fair holiday's worth of reading, eh?  So that takes my total reading for the year up to 957mm, nearly 1m tall!  And more than half way there!  (We'll gloss over the fact that we're now three quarters of the way through the year...)
