<img src='/wp-content/OpenSourceStamp.gif' alt='\&#39;GPL Certified Open Source\&#39; stamp' class="alignright" /> Today we took delivery of Andy's shiny new toy -- a stamp which allows us to mark things as being 'certified open source'.  It's intended for a postcard ad campaign.  For the main campaign, we don't think that the intended audience will be that bothered about whether the solution is open or closed source -- we're targetting IT Managers and upper management who'll be more interested in ROI and keeping an eye on their employees and productivity and other strange management-ness.  But we'd also like the postcards to be useful to target the category of people who <em>are</em> interested in our product being open source, particularly when we're at conferences or trade shows handing out these cards.  So we'll be stamping those cards with the image you see on the right.

Of course, we've been stamping <em>everything in sight</em> so far today: bits of paper, all the mail that's arrived, everything in the world ever on Clare's desk (who made the mistake of not being here today to defend it!).  And there is the threat to stamp the forehead of anybody who takes delivery of some piece of closed source software.  Just be warned if you're in the pub with any of us in the near future...  I can see a new version of <a href="http://www.realbeer.com/fun/games/games-165.php">ibble dibble</a> being the Next Big Thing!
