It's an autobiographical account of Stuart's childhood around Glasgow &amp; Blantyre (just next door to Hamilton, where I was brought up), how he became involved in a plot to blow up General Franco, spending three years in a Spanish jail for the privilege, then, within a few years of returning to the UK, being involved in the longest ever trial (at the time) in the UK as a defendant.

This book was a revelation to me.  I must admit to being uninformed with respect to our recent history.  Actually, I'm pretty much uninformed when it comes to history in general, but this book has enlightened some recent events in the 60s and 70s, at least according to Christie's point of view.  I think I'd like to learn more, although the distinct impression I got was that even those who <em>do</em> know history are <em>still</em> doomed to repeat it.  There is a lot of resonance between what he describes and what's been happening in the past year or two.  I must admit, also, to having been brought up in a nice cosy middle-of-the-road media, which basically uses 'anarchism' as a pejorative word.  It's not.  In fact, the ideals that Christie describes are sometimes pretty closely aligned to my own.

I wouldn't go as far as Time Out says -- <q>There is not a dud in the pack</q> -- but it was a good light read.

When I was compiling the list of books I'd read this year, I never did glance properly at the non-fiction section, particularly the computer books.  So I can add [The Pragmatic Programmer](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X/mathieoftheen-21) to the 'read' list, at another 18mm.  I think this book should be [The Mythical Man Month](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201835959/mathieoftheen-21) of the 21st Century and that everybody in the software engineering industry should consider it essential reading.

That takes my total to 697mm for the year so far.  I really should <em>finish</em> more of the books I've currently got open, rather than starting new books...
