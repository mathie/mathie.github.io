<img src="http://www.rubaidh.com/images/logo-graphic.gif" class="alignleft" /> I don't think I've ever 'officially' mentioned here what I'm up to these days.  Just over two months ago (1st March, to be precise), I quit my day job and started my own company:  [Rubaidh Ltd](http://www.rubaidh.com/).  I'm a one-man consultancy doing [Ruby on Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) development and hosting.  For my sins, I also still do some Python, Zope & Plone work -- it pays the rent. :)

'Rubaidh' is the Gaelic for 'ruby', which I feel encompasses the company nicely -- I'm Scottish and aim to use RoR for as much of my development work as possible.  I love both the language & framework, and feel it is better to know one thing in depth than to have a surface understanding of a dozen different frameworks.

My first application is an art gallery site, where artists can show their wares, both as their own web site and as a shared gallery with features works from a number of artists.  People will be able to browse works of art and purchase them online.  Artists will be able to create galleries, specify works of art that should be featured and manage order fulfilment.  It's still very early in development, but a friend of our family has kindly offered to be my guinea pig so already we have her site live: [Deborah Cameron](http://www.deborahcameron.com/).

And as of today, I officially have another customer:  [Rocco Venezia](http://www.roccovenezia.com/).  We switched over the hosting last night and everything seems to be up and running smoothly.  I didn't write the application currently deployed (credit for that goes to Martin @ [Faster, Stronger, Lighter](http://www.fasterstrongerlighter.com/)), but I've spent the past few days tweaking things so that it suits my deployment a bit better.  And fixing up a few bugs.  You can see a bit more about the site and what we do for them in [their customer profile](http://www.rubaidh.com/customers/more/3).  I can certainly highly recommend their [coffee](http://www.roccovenezia.com/shop/caffe/), and if I drop enough subtle hints in the right direction, I may soon be able to personally recommend their [Prosecco](http://www.roccovenezia.com/shop/wines/) too. :)

Please have a look around [rubaidh.com](http://www.rubaidh.com/) and let me know what you think.  In particular, feel free to marvel at all my [lovely, shiny customers](http://www.rubaidh.com/customers/).

In other news, I've updated the [Google Analytics plugin](http://woss.name/2006/05/09/google-analytics-plugin/) I released yesterday.
