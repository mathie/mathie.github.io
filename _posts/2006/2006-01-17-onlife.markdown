I'm impressed.  It has been collecting and collating all that I've been doing (at least in the applications it supports), producing lists of the web pages I've been surfing, email messages I've been reading, news feed items I've lingered over.  It shows how long I'm spending in each application, what I'm doing.

Mostly it should shame me into getting on with more work. :-)  Actually, no, that's not true; it's been showing me just how hard I have been working. :-)

One feature I would appreciate from it, though.  It tries hard to be smart and tell you <em>what</em> you are doing in each application.  However that does rely on some application-specific code to determine what's going on.  That's really neat, and it's even better that this functionality has been factored into a plugin architecture -- I hope that lots of people implement plugins for the applications I regularly use.  However, it would be really useful if it could fallback to simply showing the active application if it can't determine any more data.

If only it had done that, it would have shown how much time I spent in <a title="TextMate" href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> yesterday!Â  It's on my kGTD todo list to do the implementation myself, but it's currently buried under another 10,000 items!
