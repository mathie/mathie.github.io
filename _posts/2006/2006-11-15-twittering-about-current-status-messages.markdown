<img class="alignright" src="http://woss.name/dist/fuzzy_logic.png" /> I
discovered (via [Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/) talking about
[Dunstan's](http://www.1976design.com/) new job with Flickr) a new web
application called [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/). It allows you to write
short 'status' messages through a number of mechanisms, and to keep up with
other people's status messages in a similar manner. I can submit messages
directly through their web site, by IM (using Jabber/GTalk) or by text
message, which means I can trivially update my status pretty much wherever I
am. I can also receive friends' status messages through all these mechanisms.

In practice, I can see it having a few practical purposes. I can effectively
have an accurate status message of where I am/what I'm doing at all times,
plastered across my web page. I'm not sure I see the point in other people
being able to receive these messages on their mobile phones (for example). On
the other hand, being able to send a message (I'm off to the Regent for a
swift 'alf after work) being broadcast to my local friends could be a useful
feature should any of them fancy joining me there for a while...

I'm going to have a wee play around with it over the next couple of weeks and see what it's like.  The biggest barrier will be actually remembering to ever update it.  So, I don't suppose other people around here (particularly, as I say, people in my locality) fancy trying it out too?  You can find my profile here: <http://twitter.com/mathie> and you can sign up here: <http://twitter.com/account/create>.

Smells to me like it's a [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) app too...  I'd had in the back of my mind the idea of doing something similar.  I'd even gotten around to registering the domain name my-status.com after [Fraser Speirs](http://fraserspeirs.livejournal.com/) talked about the idea of [personal status messages](http://fraserspeirs.livejournal.com/1017529.html) back in March.  I'm glad somebody else has implemented it and saved me the bother!

Oh, the image has nothing to do with anything, I just thought Annabel would appreciate my little tweak to [today's Get Fuzzy](http://www.comics.com//comics/getfuzzy/archive/getfuzzy-20061115.html). :-)
