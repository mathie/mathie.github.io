<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathie/276034717/" title=""><img src="http://static.flickr.com/86/276034717_099020f572_m.jpg" alt="" class="alignright" style="border: solid 1px #000000; float: right;" /></a>I've finally gotten around to uploading a set of the photographs I took at Jon & April's wedding in September.  (Finally, I'm getting the hang of using Aperture and Flickr together, and it's just clicked for my photo workflow!)  You can view the complete set here: [Jon &amp; April's Wedding](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathie/sets/72157594305617480/).</p>

I'd like suggestions for titles, descriptions and/or tags. :)
