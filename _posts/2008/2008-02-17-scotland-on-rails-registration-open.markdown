With Keynotes from [Michael Koziarski](http://www.koziarski.net/) (nzkoz) and [David A Black](http://dablog.rubypal.com/), along with another 15 Rails luminaries doing talks on bleeding-edge topics, it's set to be the best Rails conference this side of the pond!<br /></p>
<br />
The conference is on Friday 4th April - Saturday 5th April, with a charity tutorial day on Thursday 3rd April to raise money for the utterly awesome [Children's Hospice Association Scotland](http://www.chas.org.uk/).<br />
<br />
Head along now to [scotlandonrails.com/register](http://scotlandonrails.com/register) to book your place.  I'd get there quickly; there is limited space and we anticipate it selling out!
