<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathie/437372477/" title="013_Daniel"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/168/437372477_7b77d7bcbb_m.jpg" alt="013_Daniel" class="alignright" style="border: solid 1px #000000; float: right;" /></a>It's taken me far too long to do something with these photos from last summer, but finally I took them as the opportunity to try out Lightroom properly.  (A proper review of Lightroom will appear shortly!)<br /></p>

I don't rate myself at all at taking portraits, but Olivia and Daniel are just so photogenic that I reckon it'd be impossible to take a bad picture of them.  I'm really pleased with these results.  Take a look through the [entire photoset](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mathie/sets/72157600032359381/) and tell me what you think!
