Thanks to the events of the past couple of years, I've had the opportunity to
explore a variety of methodologies for approaching counselling/therapy, with a
particular focus on talking therapies that help to combat depression and
anxiety. First things, first: I'm not entirely clear on the difference between
therapy and counselling, so I'll probably use the phrases interchangeably. It's
perhaps worth noting, though, that a Clinical Psychologist (which is a
protected title[^1][^2]) will talk about therapy, which tends to suggest to me
that therapy is more "proper". I suspect it's similar to the difference between
a software developer who's a contractor, and one who is a consultant: the
latter will cost you more.

There are several forms of therapy. Each have their own values and techniques.
Every one of them is worthwhile, and you'll get a lot out of trying any one of
them if you need it. Some therapies work better with particular people, or
particular mindsets. But a lot of it is down to your relationship with the
therapist: if you get on well with the therapist -- if you feel that you're
being heard, and understood -- then it doesn't really matter which particular
methodology you follow. In that sense, it's the same as with software
development methodologies: with the right team, who believe in a common goal,
it doesn't matter if you're Agile, or Lean, or even Waterfall, you're still
more likely to have a successful outcome. (I feel I should be adding footnotes
with reference to proof for these statements. Please do feel free to help me
out here!)

But with all that in mind, there are still several choices out there for
psychotherapy, and particular methodologies suit different people (just like
particular software development methodologies suit different projects). So,
what are the options? Well, there are practically as many methodologies as
there are therapists. Which one is going to suit you? I've had a little
experience of a few:

* Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)

* Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT)

* Transactional Analysis (TA)

* Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT), which overlaps quite a bit with Mindfulness.

## Common Strands

There are many common strands throughout these therapies. That in itself is
interesting -- if common ideas flow through several methodologies, it's
reasonable to figure that they are good ideas.

* Negative Filter
* Stilling the Mind
* Core Beliefs

... carry this on another day. What else do I want to talk about?

* CBT was developed by Aaron Beck, maybe mention the David Burns book I've read, talk about the various aspects of CBT
[^1]: The use of a [protected title](http://www.hcpc-uk.org.uk/aboutregistration/protectedtitles/) (in the UK, at least) means you have to be registered with the Health & Care Professions Council, usually means that you have to have passed particular exams, and that you are fit to practise in that profession. This is good, because if somebody tells you they're a Paramedic, you know you're in safe hands!

[^2]: I made the interesting discovery that you must have a particular protected title in order to access particular publications -- FIXME: Try and find the test that you can only access if you're a consultant psychologist.
